The luminaire has two modes: first, the general lighting that lights up your working space and
your desk. The second mode is for more direct
lighting, that is used if you want to get close
and focus on a specific detail.

The part holding the LED is 3D printed. The
rest is made of steel because it â€˜s better suited
for a workshop environment. It also makes an
effective counter weight so you can move the
adjustable arm around without moving the lu-
minaire itself. You can also lift it up by the steel
neck and place it wherever you want.

The shade of the luminaire is a steel plate,
bent in a way that prevents glare but still
allows the light to spread on to the working
area.
