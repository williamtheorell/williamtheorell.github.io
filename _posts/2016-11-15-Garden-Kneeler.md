# Sketches and Models

<br>

I started sketching different ideas and decided to do a garden cart functioning as a kneeler.
It would be efficient for storing tools, bringing them out in the garden and also making it easier for elderly to sit down on their knees and getting the necessary help to get up.

<br>

I made a new model of the kneeler.
Now it was no longer a cart but more like a trolley.
It could now fold together and become a lot smaller than the previous model.
It also got closer to the ground in the kneeling position.

After trying out the model and re-evaluating it was clear that I should focus on either making a good garden cart for storing and transporting tools or to focus on the garden kneeler.

I decided to continue with the garden kneeler because I thought that was the more interesting problem.

# Final Product

The product has three different positions:  
* The stroller - making it easier to transport things around in the garden.  
* The kneeler - helping the user to sit down on the knees by using the strength of their upper body minimizing the load on the back and knees.  
* Folded together - making the product easy to store.

Many people love gardening, but because of the physical strain from lifting heavy equipment and having to sit in uncomfortable positions, people have trouble doing the necessary work.

After analyzing the problem, the user, and the market I designed a portable garden tool that facilitates garden work.
The product makes every step of the experience more convenient so more people can enjoy gardening.

The product would serve as tool, helping elderly to carry out their garden work.
For younger people it could help prevent long term injuries or just make gardening a more convenient experience.
